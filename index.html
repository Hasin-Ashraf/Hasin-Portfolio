                            <h3>ü§ñ Understanding Human Action Intention for Robotics</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Question:</strong> How do we enable robots to understand what actions a given person intends to perform?
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Inspired by the book <em>Three stages of dynamic brain cognitive model of understanding actions intention displayed by human body movements</em>, which describes:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Body Perception Stage:</strong> The brain processes information about body parts and shapes, using areas like EBA and FBA to recognize visual cues and distinctive features.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Action Identification Stage:</strong> The brain differentiates observed actions, analyzes relationships, and uses the Mirror Neuron System (MNS) for spatial information and empathy.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Intention Understanding Stage:</strong> The Mentalizing System helps us interpret others' mental states, beliefs, and desires, influenced by context and culture.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Application:</strong> Visual sensors can help robots interpret human actions and intentions, improving human-robot interaction.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    <strong>Zero-Day Attack Prevention:</strong><br>
                                    As a cyber security engineer, I have witnessed many attacks, but zero-day attacks are the most challenging. These occur when malware signatures are unknown and can masquerade as legitimate processes.<br>
                                    <span class="highlight">Idea:</span> Develop mechanisms so only authenticated, legitimate files can access critical system processes, making it harder for zero-day malware to compromise devices.

                                    <strong>Ransomware Resilience for Financial Systems:</strong><br>
                                    Cyber attacker groups often use ransomware to block transactions and demand payment.<br>
                                    <span class="highlight">Idea:</span> Create security mechanisms to support banking and transactional systems, allowing business continuity even during attacks.

                    <p>Previously worked as a SOC (Security operations center) analyst with more than 2 years of experience in integrating security related technologies according to the organizational business need. As an offensive security and SOC analyst, I look after the firewalls such as Checkpoint and Palo-alto to monitor suspicious networking activity and the IP's the attackers generally target, along with IBM Qradar, which focuses on the entire organization's network activities and abnormalities as per our self-designed playbooks. I also look after the Crowd strike, Symantec ecosystem, where I focus on day-to-day security incidents, from malware hunting to observing the system & application files malware tends to target, along with behavioral intrusion attacks. I observe malware‚Äôs behavior through sandboxing and real-life trends. </p>
                    <p>I have also done some certification on the topic of Cyber Security, Project management and UI/UX designing till now.</p>
